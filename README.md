##   This simple Send Money Application Task




## ðŸ’š architecture and libray
 

1. I used Clean Architecture to develop the application, as it allows for easy scalability and easier issue resolution.
2. I used Room Database to store information (Send Money Data).
3. I used Jetpack Compose to design the application.
4. utilized Material Design icons with Kotlin Compose .
5. I developed my own custom Serializer class (GenericTypeSerializer) to manipulate the data. Since the data types can vary from one object to another (e.g., Max Length might sometimes be null, Int, String, etc.), the standard Kotlin serialization wouldn't work well in this case.
6. used ViewModel to manage the UI state flow and to handle the use-case logic within the ViewModel.
7. implemented Kotlin extension functions so I don't need to pass parameters. Instead, I can directly use the current object (this) to access the values and add additional functionality to manipulate the data.
